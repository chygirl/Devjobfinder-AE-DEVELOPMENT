# Devjobfinder-AE-DEVELOPMENT

My project is a decentralized Job Portal where all jobs applications are registered and displayed on the blockchain.

All applications are displayed and registered on the blockchain to aid transparency and openess in the job search market which has become a thing of concern in the transparency of job search and employment index yearly.

i narrowed it to developers job search and application because the amount of jobs and developers application in the Dev space has been increasing over few years.

HOW TO USE THE WEBSITE:

1: scroll through the jobs.
2: pick a job.
3: hit the apply button.
4: fill in your required information on the pop up form.
5: hit apply buuton.
6: wait for updating.
7: Then scroll up to nav bar.
8: hit on applied jobs nav link.
9: wait for loading animation.
10: :) applications displays.

with that you application has been recorded on te blockchain.

simple and straight foward.
