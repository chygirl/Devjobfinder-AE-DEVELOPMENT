# Devjobfinder-AE-DEVELOPMENT

My project is a decentralized Job Portal where all jobs applications are registered and displayed on the blockchain.

All applications are displayed and registered on the blockchain to aid transparency and openness in the job search market which has become a thing of concern in the transparency of job search and employment index yearly.

I narrowed it to developers job search and application because the number of jobs and developers application in the Dev space has been increasing over a few years now.

with this when the amount of job applications is published by firms yearly it can be transparent and correctly accounted for in the job search market.

companies can adopt in their job application portals to aid transparency using blockchain technology  üòÅ‚úî.
